# HackerRank---Min-Binary-Swaps
Given a binary array, find the minimum swaps to group all 1's and 0's together.

This was a question from my IBM Back-End developer HackerRank Intern Challenge.
The goal was to find the minimum numbers of swaps required to group all the 1's and 0's together in a given binary array. 
I was able to solve the question, but couldn't keep it under the required time complexity.
So I gave it another go, and this program only goes through the array twice, once incrementing through the array, and once in reverse.
It checks both ways and gives the minimum out of the two.

Hopefully, it helps!

PS: If someone can find this question on HackerRank, I would like to try all there test cases. Or if u have any.
